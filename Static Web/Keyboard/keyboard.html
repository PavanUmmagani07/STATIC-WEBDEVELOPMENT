                    typing experiences. Mechanical keyboards are known for their tactile feedback and audible clicks, favored by gamers and typists for precision and comfort. On the 
                    other hand, membrane keyboards are quieter and more common in everyday use. Keyboards also feature additional keys for functions like volume control, multimedia playback, 
                    and shortcuts, enhancing productivity. Wireless and ergonomic keyboards have become popular, promoting flexibility and comfort during prolonged use.
